However, as the Kava network continues to grow, we are witnessing a concentration of power in the hands of a few large validators.\\nCurrently, the top 4 validators control more than 44% of the voting power  meaning that any proposal can pass or fail with just their support. In our opinion, this is not a truly decentralized blockchain.\\nWe reached out to Kava community on discord about the immense amount control in the hands of a few. We were informed that the top 4 validators do not vote on any proposal. We really appreciate that from the top 4 validators, but we believe in true decentralization. Trusting someone to be responsible has not worked very well lately.\\nThis is not true **DECENTRALIZATION** if we just **HOPE** that the largest validators do not vote to harm the network.\\n\\n**Solution**:\\nCurrently, trends suggest that delegators flock to validators offering 0%/unsustainably low commission. This makes it very difficult for validators with a small number of delegators to stay competitive, as validators rely on commissions to cover the expenses of maintaining their nodes.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we propose setting a minimum validator commission rate of 5%. This will create a more level playing field and help to ensure that smaller and newer validators are able to participate in the network, promoting a more diverse and decentralized network.\\nThe top validators continue to accumulate a larger share of Delegations while the bottom 95% of validators are forced to cut costs, reducing the overall security of the network.\\n\\nLet’s look at a real example of these costs:\\nThe minimum hardware costs for a validator are ~$200 per month, while more advanced and secure configurations (ex; Sentry) can cost anywhere between $600-800/month (including maintenance).\\nLet’s look at an average validator (Validator at rank #51)\\nTotal Stake = 141,737 Kava\\nApproximate Staking Reward = 141,737 X 21% = 29,764 Kava\\nIf this validator earns 5% commission = 29,764 x 5% = 1,488 Kava = $1,500 = $125 per month\\n*Stats as of 2/8/2023**\\n\\nThis makes it challenging for validators to maintain the minimum server requirements, let alone add additional security features like a Sentry node architecture.\\nA more competitive and diverse group of validators will add to the network’s decentralization, increase its’ security, and make it more resistant to malicious actors. As a community, we have a responsibility to take actions that reinforce the security of the Kava network. Setting a minimum commission (similar to those set for other Cosmos IBC networks) is a simple step towards achieving a truly decentralized Kava Network.\\n\\n**Reference**: Juno implemented a Minimum Validator Commission feature (originally copied from Stargaze). We can use the same approach. Please see [MinCommissionDecorator](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/blob/main/app/decorators/min_commission.go)\\n\\n**Vote Yes** – If you want a decentralized and secured Kava Network\\n**Vote Abstain** - If you do not wish to express an opinion but would like to contribute to the quorum\\n**Vote No** – If you only want to maximize your rewards, at the cost of reduced security and increased centralization\\n**Vote No With Veto** – If you are against this proposal and want to penalize the proposer for trying to achieve true decentralization on Kava network"},"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD","final_tally_result":{"yes":"0","abstain":"0","no":"0","no_with_veto":"0"},"submit_time":"2023-02-28T21:51:39.326512209Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-03-14T21:51:39.326512209Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"ukava","amount":"1000000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-02-28T21:51:39.326512209Z","voting_end_time":"2023-03-07T21:51:39.326512209Z"},{"proposal_id":"129","content":{"@type":"/kava.kavadist.v1beta1.CommunityPoolMultiSpendProposal","title":"Kava Rise payouts for February 2023","description":"Eligible Kava Rise participants will receive incentives from the Kava Rise program for their TVL contributions to the Kava blockchain for February 2023.
